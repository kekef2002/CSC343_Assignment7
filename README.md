## Problem

We have two philosophers (**Phil 0** and **Phil 1**) sitting at a table.

- There are **two forks**, one between each pair of philosophers.
- Each philosopher **needs two forks to eat**, but the forks are **shared** between them.
- The philosophers **alternate between thinking and eating**:
  - A philosopher **thinks** for a while (simulated by `sleep()`).
  - A philosopher **eats** for a while (by **acquiring both forks**).

We need to **avoid deadlock** while ensuring that **both philosophers can eat**.

## Requirements

- Use **two mutex locks or semaphores** to ensure **mutual exclusion** in accessing forks.
- Implement **deadlock-free synchronization** for the two philosophers.
